# TO DO

## Bugs
- "restart is not a function" (has to do with onclick in HTML?)

## Security
- sanitize user input
- better error handling

## Performance
- create timeline immediately
- load all images up front

## Expansions
- add audio/video to cards?
    - how could users add media by path??

## User interface
- error sound

## Layout
- timeline rule should always extend to full width as it expands
    - replace current hacky CSS solution with two overlapping rules

## Drag/drop
- Shift cards left on hover also?

## Project

- Add, fill in timelines
- Put online
