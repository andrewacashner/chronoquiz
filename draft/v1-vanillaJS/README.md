# Description

This timeline game gives users a series of clues in random order. Each clue
contains a historical fact and an optional image. Below the clues is a
timeline starting with one card for "Now" with the current year. The user
drags the clues one by one onto the timeline, slotting them in the correct
place in chronological order. If they are correct, the card is inserted and
the date is revealed. If not, a warning is given and they can try again.J
The score increments for each correct guess, and decrements for each
increment guess, but never goes below zero.
After the last card is put into the timeline, a "game over" message shows
with the final score.

Users can select from a list of premade timelines or upload their own in
JSON format, as described on the About page.
